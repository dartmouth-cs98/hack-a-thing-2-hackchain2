###Desctiption 
The following is a hyperledger network created from the  https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-blockchain-network-using-hyperledger-fabric-and-composer-e06644ff801d tutorial. 

The Network is for trading cards where users can transact cards with eachother.

Added ontop of the tutorial is a function to delete cards from the network. 

###What I Did
Ontop of the original tutorial I created a function that deletes cards. JT created his own branch 

###What I learned 
I learned how hyperledger works and the potential for blockchain based networks.

###Inspiration 
We plan on creating a blockchain based network. Hyperledger gives some insight into what a blockchain network can do. 

###It Worked!!!!
